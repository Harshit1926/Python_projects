# SECRET CODE GENERATOR & DECODER

A Python program that encrypts and deciphers text using a simple character manipulation technique. Words are transformed based on their length, ensuring a unique encoding pattern. The project demonstrates proficiency in string manipulation, conditional logic, and user interaction.

# FEATURES

1. Custom Encoding & Decoding: Encrypts text using predefined logic and restores it accurately.

2. Word-Based Transformation: Adjusts structure based on word length for added complexity.

3. User-Friendly Input Handling: Allows interactive text encryption and decryption.

# ENCODING 

1. Words with 3 or more letters are modified.

2. A prefix (ghf) is added.

3. The first letter moves to the end.

4. A suffix (hhv) is added.

5. Example: "hello" â†’ "ghfellohhv".

6. Short words are reversed.

# DECODING 

1. The transformation is reversed for encoded words

2. Short words are flipped back to their original form.

# HOW TO USE

1. Run the script in a Python Environment.

2. Choose: 1 to encode a message. 2 to decode a message.

3. Enter the text.

4. The program converts and displays the result.
